# Hi there 👋

Welcome to the HomeAll nerd cave!  
Where YAML meets caffeine, and **everything can (and probably should) be automated**.

- 🛠️ **DevOps Maniac** — Ansible? Terraform? Terragrunt? Yes, please.
- 🏠 **Homelab Pro** — Proxmox clusters are my spirit animal.
- 🚀 **GitOps or bust!** — If it’s not in Git, does it even exist?

We break things so you don’t have to.  
We automate things so we can break even more things, faster.

☕️ If my scripts saved you from rage-quitting your homelab, buy me a coffee!
