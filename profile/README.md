**Automate smarter with AI + n8n.** 🤖⚡

Short, copy-paste tutorials and real DevOps tips from a homelab-obsessed engineer who thinks sleep is overrated. 🏠🧪☕

**Mission:** We break things so you don't have to — and automate so we can break *better* next time. 🔁🔥

### What you'll get 📦
- 🧩 **n8n workflows & AI agents** (Claude, OpenAI, MCP)  
- 🔗 **Webhooks, APIs, scraping, observability** that actually work
- 🛠️ **Practical DevOps:** GitOps, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Proxmox  
- 🎁 **Free templates + project code** (because sharing is caring)

### 🎮 Choose Your Adventure

> ./run_workflow.sh --help
Usage: ./run_workflow.sh [--pray] [--backup-first] [--blame-dns]
  --pray          Increases success rate by 12%
  --backup-first  For the cautious (recommended)
  --blame-dns     When all else fails (works 60% of the time, every time)

☕️ If my scripts saved you from rage-quitting your homelab, [![buy me a coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/buy%20me%20a%20coffee-yellow?logo=buymeacoffee&logoColor=white)](https://buymeacoffee.com/homeall)!

*Your uptime will thank you. Your sanity will thank you. Your server rack... well, it'll probably still be loud, but at least it'll be* **automated** *loud.* 🔊🤖

**P.S.** No homelabs were harmed in the making of these workflows. *(Okay, fine, three servers, two network switches, and one very confused UPS. But hey, that's how we discovered that "turning it off and on again" works even better when automated!)* 💾🔥⚡

**P.P.S.** If your automation gains sentience and starts ordering pizza at 3 AM, that's a feature, not a bug. We call it "predictive hunger management." 🍕🤖
